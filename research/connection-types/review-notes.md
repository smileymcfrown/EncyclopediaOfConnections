# Run 2 review notes (things to fix before entries are published)

Collected from the research agents' hand-back reports during `/research-deep`. None of these
break validation; they are clean-ups for the report step or Phase 1.

## Sources and links
- **Machinery's Handbook read from an unofficial PDF** (theswissbay.ch), listed in `sources`
  of *Ratchet and pawl* and *Linear ratchet*. It is not in `links`. When publishing, cite the
  book by edition and page (27th ed., pp. 2088–2089) and drop the URL, following run 1's rule
  of not linking unauthorised copies.
- **Printables models cited through the API**: printables.com model pages return 403 to the
  agents, so they read models through `https://api.printables.com/graphql/`. Where no page URL
  was confirmed, `make_it_yourself` entries point at the API URL with the model ID in the title
  (*Friction slip clutch*, *Shear-pin coupling*, *Torque-limiting gear*). Replace each with the
  model's page URL (`printables.com/model/<id>-<slug>`) after opening it in a browser.
- **YouTube videos** were confirmed by title and channel through YouTube's oEmbed service, not watched.
- **Firgelli (firgelliauto.com)** is a vendor explainer blog; agents labelled any number taken
  from it as secondary. Check those numbers before they go into `rules_of_thumb`.

## Content corrections found by the agents
- *Linear ratchet*: tie-down ratchet straps wind webbing on a spool with a rotary ratchet,
  so they are not linear ratchets; most quick-grip bar clamps have no teeth and use a tilting
  binding plate (see *Binding-plate lock*). The entry explains this; the outline description
  should be updated to match.
- *Friction slip clutch*: a motorcycle "slipper clutch" is a back-torque limiter, not the same
  as the RC-car slipper clutch. The entry says so.
- *Wrap-spring clutch*: the roller-blind chain clutch is really a two-way anti-back-drive
  clutch; linked from *Bidirectional anti-back-drive clutch*.

## Environment notes
- Each research agent has its own 200-search WebSearch limit. Agents with 3 items often reach
  it near the end and finish with WebFetch; this is expected and doesn't need a setting change.
- Blocked or unreadable for agents: Printables and MakerWorld pages, Thingiverse (JavaScript),
  Cults3D, MyMiniFactory, BYU CMR site, ResearchGate, ScienceDirect, ASME, Eng-Tips, github.com
  HTML pages (raw files work), some forums.
